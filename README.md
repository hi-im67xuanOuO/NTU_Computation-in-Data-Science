1. Hill Climbing
2. Random Walk
3. Simulated Annealing(SA)
4. Tabu Search(TS)
5. Ant Colony
6. Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO)
7. Genetic Algorithm(GA).

#### HW1-1
Q1. Optimization of the function using SA, Hill Climbing, Tabu Search, and Random Walk. (Please refer to ```HW1_1/1.py```)

Q2. Optimization of travel routes for South Korea Cities. (The distances are collected from webpages and are shown in code.) (Please refer to ```HW1_1/2.py```)

Q3. (Bonus) More on optimization of travel routes. Comparisons on different Algorithms. (Please refer to ```HW1_1/3.py```)

#### HW1-2
Q1. Optimization of a Function via Particle Swarm Optimization. (Please refer to ```HW1_2/1.py```)

Q2. Knapsack Problem via Genetic Algorithm. (Please refer to ```HW1_2/2.py and HW1_2/2-2.py```)

Q3. (Bonus) Linear Programming to solve Q1 and Q2. Comparisons on solutions of PSO and GA. (Please refer to ```HW1_2/3.py```)

#### HW1-Final
A Revision on Traveler Salesman Problem. (Please refer to ```HW1_Final/algorithm.ipynb```, and the distances are calculated in ```HW1_Final/dist.ipynb```.)

The parameters settings are shown in the page 2 of ```HW1_Final/R10946013_Final_report.pdf```. 

Also, the new method **Cuckoo Search** is tried by myself for bonus and are shown in the code and report file.

### About HW2
PCA and model training for applications.

#### HW2-1
Main Goal: Expiriments are conducted to shown the importance of PCA and the correlations on standard deviation and PCA. (Please refer to ```HW2_1/R10946013_HW1.R```)

#### HW2-2
Main Goal: Applications of data science in biomedicine. (Please refer to ```HW2_1/r10946013_HW2.ipynb```)

#### HW2 Final
Main Goal: Workflow of Machine Learning including **feature selection** (LASSO, ANOVA, Tree-based methods) , model training, evaluation metrics, and cross validation.

### About HW3
Mathematics for Data Science (Please refer to ```HW3_1.pdf, HW3_2.pdf, HW3_3.pdf, and HW3_4.pdf```)
